<h3>Scenario:</h3>
The basis for the assignment is a website that allows a user to track the time spent on each project.
There are two types of users, a general user who can participate in a project and an administrator who
can add new users to a project, and create projects. 
Each user should be able to set up new tasks and track the time spent on each task by clicking on a button.
The admin is able to create new projects and allocate users to a it. The administrator also is able to look at
the overall time spent on each project and the costs that have incurred so far. 
An administrator also has the possibility to create and reassign tasks to different users in the project, respectively manage the projects ressources.
A normal user can download a timesheet on daily, weekly and monthly basis, to be signed off by the management. The administrator can download a summary report of time spent on the project by day, week, month, and overall.
